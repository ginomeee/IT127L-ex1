# IT127L Module 1 Exer 1 under Mam Antonette Gabriel
## Serializer and deserializer program
Use Netbeans IDE to access and run the Java files. The main files are Serialize and Deserialize. This updates a file (araullo.xml) located under `C:\Dev\IT127L\ex1\` with the Arraylist included in the Serializer class.

#### Make sure that araullo.xml exists under `C:\Dev\IT127L\ex1` in order for this to work!
